# MagicAxe-Minecraft-1.20.2


WHAT is this repo?
-> This is the time I tried to learn minecraft modding as 1 week learning project.
Learning from https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKGarocXCE1EO43Dlf5JGh7Yk-kRAXUEJ&si=8Dy9xoZshDoGh6Lk

WHY minecraft modding?
-> Because I have played minecraft since I was little kid. And I think "Wait, I am a programmer now why not try modding around?".
Starting from that, I started my quick tour for 1 week modding. Another thing is minecraft has big community which tutorials are easier to find.

HOW do I develop the mod?
-> So I learned a few tutorial from Kaupenjoe. (https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKGarocXCE1EO43Dlf5JGh7Yk-kRAXUEJ&si=8Dy9xoZshDoGh6Lk)
With my understanding of C#, it is not so hard to understand JAVA syntax. I just learn some basic tutorials and add my own tweaks to the game.

I also reseach the syntax and some methods/functions from the sources code so that I understand deeper around the structure of minecraft code base.
I learnt doing that from Unreal Engine Course in udemy where it taught me to look into the source for quicker and more clear of what the code can do.
